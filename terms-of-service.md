# Terms of Service
**Effective Date:** 9/25/2025
## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By using Spamtrap (the "Bot"), you agree to comply with these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Bot.
## 2. Bot Purpose
Spamtrap is designed to help Discord server owners detect and remove spam bots. It automatically kicks members who type in configured "trap channels" and log their messages to a designated logging channel.
## 3. User Responsibilities
- You must have the right to manage the Discord server where Spamtrap is installed.
- You must use the Bot only for legal purposes and in accordance with [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
- You are responsible for configuring Spamtrap properly and reviewing its logs.
## 4. Data Collection & Usage
Spamtrap **only stores the following data:**
- Guild ID
- Configured spam kick message
- Configured "trap channel" IDs
- Configured allow-listed channel IDs
- Configured logging channel IDs
This data is used **solely** to operate the Bot as intended. Spamtrap **does not store messages outside of temporarily logging spam bot messages** (up to 50 per channel), and it does not collect personal information beyond what is listed.
## 5. Limitation of Liability
- Spamtrap is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.
- The Bot owner is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of Spamtrap.
- You acknowledge that the Bot may accidentally kick users if misconfigured.
